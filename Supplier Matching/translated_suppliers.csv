Mr. Matthias Mueller - Managing Director, Paul Mueller GmbH

History of Paul Mueller GmbH:

When the Mueller brothers, Anton and Paul, founded a company of the same name in Balve, Sauerland in 1959, no one could have foreseen that this would be the beginning of an extraordinary success story.

Since then, our company has undergone continuous development. With the establishment of a branch plant in Nordhausen, Thuringia in 1992, we responded to the increasingly demanding requirements of the industry.

Since 2004, our expansion strategy has continued to advance with the foundation of the following partner companies:

The path as an OEM supplier, who designs, engineers, and manufactures tailor-made insulation solutions, is consistently followed and steadily expanded, showing a strong upward trend in recent years.
